# Rest Countries

Basic web app that fetches a list of countries from the [rest countries](https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints) public API.

## Features

The app is divided in three pages. The first one lists all the countries, the
second page only gathers the countries from the European Union and the third page
allows to search countries worlwide.

## Usage

The project uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
to run the app. I used [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/v6)
to display the results in an elegant way and with a pagination. I also used [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) to add a few components and some style.

Start

```
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
